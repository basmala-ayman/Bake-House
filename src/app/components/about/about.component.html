          The journey of Bake House began in 2002 when the first branch was opened in Maadi on Street 9. That’s when we
          started writing the history of Bake House and carving a big name in the production of Eastern and Western sweets as
          well as bakery. 
          <br>
          <br>
          Since the very beginning, our main goal is to share with people their happiness and joy on various occasions and
          draw a smile on the faces of Egyptian family members by offering a variety of high-quality products.
          <br>
          <br>
          For instance, our bakery products, such as pates, croissants and Danish are always a good choice for breakfast or a
          quick snack. Western and Oriental sweets as well as chocolates are gifting products that are always available in
          every Egyptian household.
          <br>
          <br>
          When it comes to special occasions, either Eid or Mouled el Nabi, we are honored that our customers can
          always rely on us. <br>

            In 2011, since our clients love our products and because of high demand, our ambition began to increase. That’s when
            we started our expansion plan, by distributing products such as Yameesh Ramadan, Kahk el Eid and Halawet Mouled in
            the largest supermarket and hyper market chains.
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            To fulfill our goal to expand and be accessible to our customers Everywhere, we began opening new stores
            and the most recent one is in City Center Almaza in May 2023, totaling up to 11 stores in the span of 4 years.
            <br>
            <br>
